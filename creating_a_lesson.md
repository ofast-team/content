Here are some quick steps for creating an O(fast) lesson

1. Create a directory with all of the lesson components

   - you can find instructions on how to make the lesson components here
   <!-- TODO(cam): add instructions about how to make each component (e.a. reading, fill in the blank, multiple choice) -->

2. Create a lesson.json which will contain an array of how to order the components on the page in your lesson [lesson.json](dynamic_programming/lesson.json)
3. Add the directory name to the [lessons.json](lessons.json) file
4. Make a pull request with the markdown file(s) you've added
5. The pull request with be reviewed by an O(fast) team member, and you'll have the chance to update the pull request and make any requested changes
